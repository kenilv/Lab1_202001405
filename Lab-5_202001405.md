**Static Analysis Tool Used:** Pylint. Pylint analyses your code without actually running it. It checks for errors, enforces a coding standard, looks for code smells, and can make suggestions about how the code could be refactored.\
**Command to Install Pylint:** python -m pip install pylint \
**Command to Run Pylint on any Python File:** pylint app.py

**Lines 15,16,17 and 18** : "Doesn't conform to UPPER_CASE naming style (invalid-name).": This error is true positive and occured due to lowercase naming style obtained by the variables. 

**Line 21** : "Missing Function or Method Docstring (method-function-docstring).": The error is true positive and refers to the missing module that is needed to be added

**Lines 29 and 35** : "Using open without explicitly specifying an encoding (unspecified-encoding)": This error is True Positive as the code file does not mention the encoding. Using the system default implicitly can create problems on other operating systems.
